# TechBridge Capstone: Smile Mart Chatbot Security Upgrade with Azure Spring App

## Overview

This repository is part of the TechBridge Capstone Project, focusing on the Smile Mart Assistant
Chatbot. The project encompasses the deployment of a chatbot using Azure Language for natural
language processing and Azure QnA for handling question-answer pairs. A critical aspect of this
project was addressing a security oversight identified during the GitHub deployment phase.

Additionally, the Smile Mart project includes a separate repository dedicated to the store's landing
page, containing the front-end components and design elements of the Smile Mart Store. This related
repository forms the initial part of the Smile Mart project.

## Project Implementation

### Initial Setup and Security Oversight

After successfully setting up the Smile Mart Assistant chatbot, a significant security concern was
identified. The iframe link, generated by Azure Language, was inadvertently exposing the private key
in the GitHub repository.

### Addressing the Security Challenge

Due to the limitations of the Azure Basic pricing tier, particularly the lack of access to the
properties file feature (exclusive to the Enterprise tier), an alternative solution was necessary.
This feature, typically used for the secure storage of environment variables including keys, was not
available in our chosen tier.

#### Solution Strategy

To mitigate this security issue, we employed Azure Spring Apps to create a temporary token
generator. This approach ensured that our sensitive keys were securely managed, without direct
exposure in the repository. The integration of this solution with Azure Spring Apps CI/CD through
GitHub Actions further enhanced our deployment process.

### Deployment Steps

#### Step 1: Deployment to Azure Spring Apps

1. **Plan Selection:** The project utilized the Azure Spring Apps Standard consumption and dedicated
   (Preview) plan.
2. **Reference Guide:** For setup details, refer to the [Azure Spring Apps Quickstart
   Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/spring-apps/quickstart?tabs=Azure-Developer-CLI%2CAzure-portal-ent%2CConsumption-workload&pivots=sc-consumption-plan).

#### Step 2: Azure Spring Apps CI/CD using GitHub Actions for Java

1. **Programming Language:** The project was implemented using Java.
2. **Setup Guide:** Step-by-step instructions can be found in the [Azure Spring Apps CI/CD GitHub
   Actions
   Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/spring-apps/how-to-github-actions?pivots=programming-language-java).

### Conclusion

This project showcases the effective use of Azure services in building a secure chatbot solution.
The identification and resolution of the security issue underline the importance of robust security
practices in software development, especially in cloud-based applications.

## Executive Summary
The Smile Mart Assistant Chatbot project encapsulates the integration of Azure Cognitive Services and Azure Spring Apps to enhance customer interaction within the Smile Mart retail environment. This solution aims to streamline customer service operations, reduce wait times, and provide 24/7 assistance, leading to an overall improved customer experience and satisfaction.

## Team & Responsibilities

### Team:
- Melissa Vargas
- Mary Nichols
- Gaetano Barreca
- Kendall Drummond
- Kayla Thorne
- Yvonne Sudlow

## Technical Approach
Our project harnesses the capabilities of Azure Cognitive Services, specifically QnA Maker, for its natural language processing prowess, paired with Azure Spring Apps for a robust backend. The integration with GitHub Actions facilitates continuous integration and deployment, ensuring smooth and consistent updates.

### Chatbot Solution:
- **QnA Maker** to understand and respond to customer queries
- **Azure Spring Apps** for scalable backend services
- **(GitHub Actions)[https://docs.github.com/actions]** for streamlined deployment workflows

### Backend Development:
- **Java** for robust and efficient backend logic
- **Azure Spring Apps (ASA)** leveraged for secure token generation and management
- Hosted on **GitHub Pages** for easy access and visibility

### Technical Limitations and Future Upgrades:
- Limited to current Azure tier features with plans to evaluate the upgrade to Azure Enterprise for expanded capabilities
- Development of a roadmap for incorporating additional Azure services and creating a more personalized user experience

## Business Case
The Assistant Chatbot acts as a virtual customer service representative, capable of handling a wide array of customer inquiries without human intervention, allowing Smile Mart to allocate human resources more effectively and improving operational efficiency.

## Development and Deployment Guide
A step-by-step guide for development and deployment.


## Development and Deployment Guide
